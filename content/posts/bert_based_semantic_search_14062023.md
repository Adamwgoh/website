title: "BERT based Semantic Search (12 June 2023)"
date: 2023-06-09T10:15:27+08:00
tags: ['nlp', 'machine learning']

Previously, we looked at building a semantic search engine using TF-IDF matrix as its embeddings. In this post, we will look into using BERT embeddings for our similarity search

We use a similar set of data as we did previously.

```python
def clean_text(text):
    # remove htmltags and new lines/tags
    try:
        text = re.sub(r'<.[a-zA-Z]+.>', ' ', text)
        text = re.sub(r'&.[a-zA-Z]+.;', '', text)
        #text = re.sub(r'^[a-zA-Z.]', '', text)
        text = re.sub(r'httpS+s*', ' ', text)
        text = re.sub(r'\.', '', text)

```python
if raw_data.isnull().values.any():
    raw_data.dropna(how='any', inplace=True)
raw_data.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
raw_data.set_axis(range(len(raw_data)), inplace=True)
```

We also do similar data cleaning and removing of rows with `NaN` values as well

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
import torch

# we use siamese-BERT for our embedding as it maps paragraphs and sentences into a fixed vector space
model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v2')
device = torch.device("cuda")
model.to(device)
```

The model we use is `paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v2` with [its model card here](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v2) and [paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084). The siamese sentence-BERT performs better than vanilla BERT in amount of data processed and time, as it maps paragraphs or sentences into a fixed dimension of vector space.

```python
SentenceTransformer(
  (0): Transformer({'max_seq_length': 256, 'do_lower_case': False}) with Transformer model: RobertaModel 
  (1): Pooling({'word_embedding_dimension': 768, 'pooling_mode_cls_token': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_tokens': True, 'pooling_mode_max_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_mean_sqrt_len_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_weightedmean_tokens': False, 'pooling_mode_lasttoken': False})
)
```

## Side Track..

What data to feed to Transformer models for embeddings?

[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63979544/using-trained-bert-model-and-data-preprocessing), [Additional Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69428811/how-does-bert-word-embedding-preprocess-work)

Does preprocessing of data changes how attention module in BERT I think preprocessing will not change your output predictions. I will try to explain for each case you mentioned -

1. **stemming or lemmatization** :
Bert uses BPE (**Byte- Pair Encoding** to shrink its vocab size), so words like run and running will ultimately be decoded to **run + ##ing.**
So it's better not to convert *running* into *run* because, in some NLP problems, you need that information.
2. **De-Capitalization** - Bert provides two models
(lowercase and uncased). One converts your sentence into lowercase, and
others will not change related to the capitalization of your sentence.
So you don't have to do any changes here just select the model for your
use case.
3. **Removing high-frequency words** -
Bert uses the Transformer model, which works on the attention principal.
So when you finetune it on any problem, it will look only on those words which will impact the output and not on words which are common in all
data.

```python
%time embeddings = model.encode(raw_data['jobdata'])`
CPU times: user 8min 55s, sys: 2.28 s, total: 8min 57s
Wall time: 7min
cuda_embeddings = torch.from_numpy(embeddings).float().to(device)
```

```python
# Sample queries
queries = [
    'data scientist job in financial sector', 
    'Remote only job', 
    'Web frontend react',
    'sales executive',
    'Devops AWS',
    'Cooking job'
]
```

```python
# Find the closest 5 sentences of the corpus for each query sentence based on cosine similarity
top_k = min(5, len(raw_data['jobdata']))

for query in queries:
    query_embedding = model.encode(query, convert_to_tensor=True)

    # We use cosine-similarity and torch.topk to find the highest 5 scores
    cos_scores = util.cos_sim(query_embedding, cuda_embeddings)[0]

    top_results = torch.topk(cos_scores, k=top_k)

    print("\n\n======================\n\n")
    print("Query:", query)
    print(top_results[0])
    print("\nTop 5 most similar sentences in corpus:\n")

    for score, idx in zip(top_results[0], top_results[1]):
        print(f"idx: {idx}" + " (Score: {:.4f})".format(score))
        print(f"Text:\n {raw_data['jobdata'][int(idx)]}\n")
```
