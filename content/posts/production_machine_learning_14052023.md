# Production Machine Learning

For the past two weeks, I’ve been picking up Kaggle courses as well as Coursera courses. Here are some notes taken that I think might be useful:

Adapting to Data:
Different kind of data changes

- change in distribution
- change in depedencies and change in ingested data
- Code smell
- Model not updated to new data (Cold start problem)
    - dynamic train
    - understand model limit
- Reroll old model with model versioning
- Concept drift
    - Change in P(Y|X) is a shift in the underlying relationship between model input and output
- Data drift
    - Change in P(X) is a shift in the distribution of data
- Prediction Shift (Population)
    - Change P(X|Y) is a shift in model prediction
- Output shift (Co-variate Shift)

## Tuning Performance to reduce training time

| Constraint | Input/Output | CPU | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commonly Occurs | - Large inputs
- Input requires parsing
- Small models | - Expensive Computation
- Underpowered Hardware | - Large number of inputs
- complex models |
| Take Action | - Store efficiently
- Paralleize reads
Consider batch size | - Train on faster accel.
- Upgrade processor
- Run on TPU
- Simplify model | - Add more memory
- Use fewer layers
- Reduce batch size |
|  |  |  |  |

tensorflow.distribute.strategy

- mirrored
- multi-worker mirrored
- tpu
- parameter server

`tf.distribute`

1. Create a strategy object
    
    `strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()` 
    
2. Wrap creation of model parameters within strategy scope
    
    ```python
    with strategy.scope():
    	model = create_model()
    	model.compile(
    		loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'
    		optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.0001),
    		metrics=['accuracy'])
    ```
    
3. Scale the batch size by the number of replicas in the cluster
    
    ```python
    per_replica_batch_size = 64
    global_batch_size = per_replica_batch_size \
    	* strategy.num_replicas_in_sync
    ```
